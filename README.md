Discord API library for Deno

- **Secure & stable**: Discordeno internally handle Discord rate-limitation and checks for required permission(s) before performing an API request to avoid IP ban from Discord.
- **Functional API**: Overall neat, efficient and performant API, while removing the nuisances of extending built-in classes and inheritance. This approach avoids potential memory leaks, crashes and other silly issues.
- **100% API coverage**: 
- **TypeScript & JavaScript support**: Discordeno utilizes latest TypeScript and JavaScript. Types are always up-to-date and accurate.

## Usage

### Boilerplate

Don't worry a lot of developers start out coding their first projects as a Discord bot (I did ðŸ˜‰) and it is not so easy to do so. Discordeno is built considering all the issues with pre-existing libraries and issues that I had when I first started out coding bots. 
If you are a beginner developer, you may check out these awesome official and unofficial boilerplates:

- [Official Discordeno Boilerplate](https://github.com/Skillz4Killz/Discordeno-bot-template)
- [Dencord Starter](https://github.com/ayntee/dencord-starter)
- [Add your Own]

If you do not wish to use a boilerplate, you may continue reading.

### Example

Here's a minimal example to get started with:

```typescript
import { startBot, sendMessage, Intents } from "https://deno.land/x/discordeno@10.0.0/mod.ts";

startBot({
  token: "BOT TOKEN",
  intents: [Intents.GUILDS, Intents.GUILD_MESSAGES],
  eventHandlers: {
    ready: () => console.log('Successfully connected to the gateway'),
    messageCreate(message) {
      if (message.content === "ping") {
        sendMessage(message.channelID, "Pong using Discordeno!");
      }
    },
  },
});
```
